1. is there a pre determine major for enum ? some enum is mixed and how do the student supposed to view the internships opportunity that is mixed? (doesnt seems to be working if it supposed to be showing )
2. year 3 student, computer science cannot apply to basic, intermediate , advanced internships, can view only own major internships 
3. filter when appearing for internships, we already filtered by major and Year of study(for level of internship) do we need to filter again by major, level of internship?
